## OVERVIEW
<h4>This project explores the use of machine learning and deep learning models to forecast Nifty 50 index movement using historical daily OHLCV data and technical indicators. Two primary modeling approaches were tested:


- Direction Prediction (Binary Classification) using LSTM

- Price Prediction (Regression) using LSTM

Both models were trained on approximately 3,000 daily observations (2010–2025), using technical indicators like moving averages, volatility, and returns.</h4>
